WITH cte AS (
  SELECT
    s.user_id
    ,EXTRACT(DAY FROM purchase_date - signup_date) AS diff
    ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY signup_date ORDER BY purchase_date ASC) AS rownum
  FROM signups AS s 
  LEFT JOIN user_purchases AS p ON s.user_id = p.user_id
)
SELECT
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(user_id) FILTER (WHERE rownum = 1 AND (diff <= 7 OR diff IS NULL)) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 2) AS same_week_purchases_pct
FROM cte 
;
```

SELECT ROUND(
  100.0 * 
    COUNT(DISTINCT purchases.user_id) / 
    COUNT(DISTINCT signups.user_id), 2) AS same_week_purchases_pct
FROM signups
LEFT JOIN user_purchases AS purchases
  ON signups.user_id = purchases.user_id
WHERE purchases.purchase_date IS NULL
  OR (purchases.purchase_date BETWEEN signups.signup_date 
  AND (signups.signup_date + '7 days'::INTERVAL));
```
