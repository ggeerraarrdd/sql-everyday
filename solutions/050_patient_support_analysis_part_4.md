## Patient Support Analysis (Part 4)

Site: DataLemur\
Difficulty per Site: Hard

## Problem

UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“ whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.

To analyze the performance of the program, write a query to determine the month-over-month growth rate specifically for long-calls. A long-call is defined as any call lasting more than 5 minutes (300 seconds).

Output the year and month in numerical format and chronological order, along with the growth percentage rounded to 1 decimal place. [[Full Description](https://datalemur.com/questions/long-calls-growth)]

## Submitted Solution

```sql
-- Submitted Solution
WITH cte1 AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', call_date) AS yr_mth
    ,COUNT(case_id) AS long_calls_count
  FROM callers
  WHERE call_duration_secs > 300
  GROUP BY yr_mth
)
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM yr_mth) AS yr
  ,EXTRACT(MONTH FROM yr_mth) AS mth
  ,ROUND(100.0 * (long_calls_count - LAG(long_calls_count, 1) OVER (ORDER BY yr_mth)) / LAG(long_calls_count, 1) OVER (ORDER BY yr_mth), 1) AS diff_per
FROM cte1
;
```
